## Overview

**Text to Image Generation** is an interactive web application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that lets you convert text prompts into images. You can choose between:

- **OpenAI DALL-E 3**: Generate images using OpenAI's advanced DALL-E model (requires your own API key).
- **Stable Diffusion (Open Source)**: Generate images locally with the Stable Diffusion model provided by RunwayML using the [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) library.

This app is perfect for experimenting with AI-generated art and prototyping creative ideas.

## Features

- **Model Selection**: Easily switch between OpenAI DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive design with input fields for text prompts and image count.
- **Dynamic API Key Entry**: For OpenAI DALL-E 3 users, enter your API key directly in the app sidebar.
- **Enhanced Image Generation**: Displays generated images directly in the browser.
- **NSFW Safety Bypass for Stable Diffusion**: (‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The safety checker is disabled for Stable Diffusion to prevent blank (black) images from being returned. Use responsibly.)
