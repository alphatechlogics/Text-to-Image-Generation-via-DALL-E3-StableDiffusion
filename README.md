## Overview

**Text to Image Generation** is an interactive web application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that converts your text prompts into images. You can choose between:

- **OpenAI DALL-E 3**: Generate images using OpenAI's advanced DALL-E model (_requires your own API key_).
- **Stable Diffusion (Open Source)**: Generate images locally with the Stable Diffusion model provided by RunwayML using the [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) library.

This app is perfect for experimenting with AI-generated art and prototyping creative ideas.

## Features

- **Model Selection**: Easily switch between OpenAI DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive design with intuitive input fields.
- **Dynamic API Key Entry**: For OpenAI DALL-E 3 users, simply enter your API key in the sidebar.
- **Enhanced Voice Input for Prompts**:
  - **Record Your Voice**: Use the integrated voice recording feature to capture your spoken prompt.
  - **Accurate Transcription with Whisper**: The recorded audio is converted to the required format and transcribed using OpenAI's open-source [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model.
  - **Automatic Prompt Update**: The transcribed text is automatically inserted into the prompt field so you can easily review and edit it.
- **Image Generation**: Generates a single image from your prompt and displays it directly in the browser.
- **NSFW Safety Bypass for Stable Diffusion**: (‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The safety checker is disabled for Stable Diffusion to prevent blank (black) images. Use responsibly.)

## Voice Input Functionality

The new voice input feature allows you to record your voice to generate your image prompt. Here‚Äôs how it works:

- **Recording:**

  - **Important:** Ensure your browser has microphone access enabled. If the recorder does not start, verify your permissions or try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge are recommended).
- **Audio Processing & Transcription:**

  - The recorded audio is saved and converted to 16 kHz, mono, 16-bit PCM using pydub.
  - The converted audio is then transcribed using OpenAI‚Äôs open-source Whisper model, which provides improved accuracy over previous methods.
- **Prompt Update:**

  - Once transcribed, the voice prompt text is automatically inserted into the prompt text field so you can immediately see and, if needed, edit the text before generating your image.
